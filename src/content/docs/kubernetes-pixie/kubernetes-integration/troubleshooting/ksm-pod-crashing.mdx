## Problem

The nrk8s-ksm pod is in CrashLoopBackoff.

## Solution

Check the logs for the ksm container in the pod:
```
kubectl logs nr-2-nrk8s-ksm-xxx-xx -c ksm
```

If the error message is the following:
```
"[...] KSM data was not populated after trying all endpoints, check if namespace filters are set properly"
```

Then the namespaceSelector for the namespace Filter is not matching any namespaces, so the integration is discarding all KSM data.
You must fix the selector to match at least one namespace [Link-to-namespace-filter-waiting-on-carlos-pr]().
If not scraping any namespace is the intended behaviour, you can disable scraping the KSM as described in the [Kubernetes integration Helm installation guide](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm#installing-and-configuring-nri-bundle-with-helm).
